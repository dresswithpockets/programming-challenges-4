# Challenges

Hello! This is a repository documenting challenges from [this challenge list](https://github.com/phxvyper/programming-challenges-4/blob/master/programming-challenges.png) which i have completed or am working on.

I will not be doing every challenge on this list, only a handful - for the most part, this is a vehicle for honing skills in other languages or fields I am largely inexperienced with (haha rust).
